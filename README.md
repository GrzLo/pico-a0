- added few game mechanics

to do:

- main menu
- add sound effects / music

# UPDATE (RAPORT 2)
What has been done so far?
- created basic models
- adjusted physics accordingly, to fit the game concept
- created 2 test levels
- added some puzzle elements like the ability to move boxes, moving platforms, switches
- added death mechanics (only falling down so far)
- created very simple raw textures for the game world

What needs to be done?
- create more engaging, thought out levels (more traps, puzzles, scripted events, *maybe* enemies)
- improve some classes / scripts - add extra functionalities where needed
- add some abilities like double jump, dash and more
- improve transitioning between levels

2nd priority:
- add any optional features after the core of the game is done
