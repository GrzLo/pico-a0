What has been done so far?
- created basic models
- adjusted physics accordingly, to fit the game concept
- created 2 test levels
- added some puzzle elements like the ability to move boxes, moving platforms, switches
- added death mechanics (only falling down so far)
- created very simple raw textures for the game world

What needs to be done?
- create more engaging, thought out levels (more traps, puzzles, scripted events, *maybe* enemies)

- add some abilities like double jump, dash and more
- improve transitioning between levels

2nd priority:
